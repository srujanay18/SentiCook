# SentiCook
## Contents
# Software and Platform
We used Google Colab to create a shareable python file. We used the vaderSentiment, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn packages for our sentiment analysis and data processing. We used both Windows and Mac as platforms.
# Documentation
In our GitHub Repository labeled 'SentiCook' we have a README.md to describe the structure and function of our model, a LICENSE.md file, and a SCRIPTS folder as well as a DATA folder and an OUTPUT folder.

In the SCRIPTS folder we have 1_cleaning for preprocessing scripts, 2_exploratory_plots that includes the code that performs the sentiment analysis and sets the bins for the review data, and 3_model for the scripts that allow for data analysis and contributions to our OUTPUTS folder.

In the DATA folder we have just our Recipe Reviews Dataset labeled "Recipe Reviews and User Feedback Dataset.csv" in the original_data folder. This dataset was cleaned and then processed into the final_data folder as "cleaned_recipe_reviews.csv"

In the OUTPUTS folder we have a folder for exploratory plots and then a folder for model visualizations. The exploratory plots are: f_distribution of star bins.jpg, f_distribution of stars (original scale).jpg, f_distribution of upvotes.jpg, t_categorical summaries.jpg, t_descriptive statistics.jpg, t_helpful rate summary.jpg, t_sentiment bin distribution.jpg, t_star bin distribution.jpg, t_star count and percentages.jpg, t_thumbs up:down summary.jpg, t_total, and net thumb votes.jpg. For our model visualizations we have: 


Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results. In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
