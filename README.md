# SentiCook
## Contents
# Software and Platform
We used Google Colab to create a shareable python file. We used the vaderSentiment, pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn packages for our sentiment analysis and data processing. We used both Windows and Mac as platforms.
# Documentation
In our GitHub Repository labeled 'SentiCook' we have a README.md to describe the structure and function of our model, a LICENSE.md file, and a SCRIPTS folder as well as a DATA folder and an OUTPUT folder.
In the SCRIPTS folder we have 1_cleaning for preprocessing scripts, 2_model that includes the code that performs the sentiment analysis and sets the bins for the review data, and 3_visualizations for the scripts that allow for data analysis and contributions to our OUTPUTS folder.
In the DATA folder we have just our Recipe Reviews Dataset labeled 'Recipe_Reviews_and_User_Feedback_Data.csv'. This dataset was downloaded as a .csv to then be processed and used in our model.
In the OUTPUTS folder we have <insert file names here for histograms, etc.>

Section 3: Instructions for reproducing your results. In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
